# DecisionMaker Overview
This is the project for the DecisionMaker app to decide something for me when <br>
I'm being indecisive about something trivial <br>
or if I just don't want to think about the trivial decision for too long.<br>
The application project is the DecisionMaker folder<br>
The supporting unit tests are in the DMTest folder<br>

# Dependencies
You need **dotnet 7** and **csc** to build and run the DecisionMaker.dll output<br>
If you care about the unit tests, you will need **mstest**, which comes with dotnet<br>
